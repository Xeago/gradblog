title: Development process
---

At VideofyMe development cycles are planned with durations of around 2 weeks. During this time deployments happen early and often. Members from different teams discuss interfaces as necessary and write tests for these interfaces. When a component/feature is considered done this gets deployed to production, unless there is no urge to deploy. Within VideofyMe, several teams work together on delivering a single product, service. While they may have different end-points (mobile, website), they all work together.

To fit in with this process, I propose a short development cycle (around 1 to 2 weeks) with frequent delivery of intermediate products. Waiting until the end of my internship before delivering products would spell disaster: the rest of the service would stall, codebases would divert and cause headaches on merges, lack of continuous feedback and other nuisances.  
The priority within each cycle is as follows: improve the codebase, design and architecture and secondly introduce new features or behavior. Midway through my internship I will (re-)evaluate this proposal and discuss it with my supervisors.

# (Re-)evaluation
There were no causes for concern regarding the development process. Therefore it has not been altered.
