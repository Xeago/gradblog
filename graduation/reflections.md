# VideofyMe
I experienced VideofyMe as a very nice place to work. Nice colleagues and a nice
office environment. Because they are a technology startup, they haven't seen had
an urge to define and adhere to a formal 'management hierachy'. I did not think
of this as a flaw but consider it to be quite nice.
This is the first time I have worked at/with a company delivering a single
(digital) service. I can now assert that this indeed greatly differs from my
past experiences and that I would like to work at such company.

# Assignment
It was cool that I got to define the assignment almost completely while doing
it. Combined with the flexibility at VideofyMe this was very pleasing and formed
a nice work ethic. I was able to put my focus on certain aspects of the
assignment according to my and VideofyMe's interests. This allowed me to define
the assignment to greatly enrich my knowledge and enhance my skills.

# Fulltext search
I have never worked with a fulltext search engine before. I was completely blown
away by the text analysis that Elasticsearch can do. Things like ICU, stemming
and ngrams, I didn't even know such analysis existed. Previously, I implemented
search with a fuzzy regular expression after splitting on several characters. No
longer!

# Other
The common language at the office is Swedish, I however did not experience this
as an issue. Instead, I was encouraged to do my best and ask for confirmation or
help if I was unable or uncertain what was said.

My supervisor (R. Verheijen) allowed me to work pretty much they way I wanted.
I greatly appreciate this and I hope my documentation does not disappoint you.
