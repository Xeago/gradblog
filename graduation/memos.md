These memos contain short reflections about skills acquired or knowledge gained, according to my [performance plan](performance-plan.html#ref-PI05).

I have also written a document with my [reflections] around the end of my internship.

Getting systems ready to deploy is a pain in the ass if it is a long running project. I recommend breaking big tasks up into smaller chunks than I did. While it did not cause any reasons for concern, it wasn't that fun having that much of pressure resting
needlessly on ones shoulders.

We all know that when one designs and creates a system with certain quality aspects, one has to put these to the test. In case of networking and automatic failovers I have never had the chance to fully implement and design such a system, let alone think of testing it.  
Thankfully I get to test it here. Using [Webmock] and [Vcr] I can capture, replay and manipulate networking behaviour to simulate the desired scenarios. Before I usually resorted to 'pulling the plug' myself and seeing how the system behaves. Now I can accurately verify the behavior in a quick and concise manner.

Writing DSLs in Ruby is just awesome! I took some time to study how to write DSLs in Ruby and I absolutely love it; never have I been so productive when implementing a design. **I would like to do some research on this and learn more about DSLs.**  
While implementing the design I felt my knowledge of the [elasticsearch query language][Query-DSL] was severely lacking. I spent a minor amount of time on this earlier on but I felt like I didn't grasp the constructs as well as I needed to. In hindsight, it can be compared with any other query language, like [SQL](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=53681), [Hive](hive.apache.org), and [HBase](hbase.apache.org). You have to have expertise in the language to full take advantage of it. As I was only a bit behind schedule and I felt this was mandatory knowledge and experience, I set time apart to study the [elasticsearch query language][Query-DSL]. I tried querying the VideofyMe's test-data for every use I could find given any construct of the query language â€” it was a stretch. In this learning process, [Clinton] [Gormley] was of excellent assistance on [#elasticsearch]. I would like to thank him for his everlasting patience and help.

On my initial day working on the code in the API (this is only accessibly by other VideofyMe components), I was dumbfound on how it works. I could see it was separated according to MVC. I found no authentication, authorization nor security whatsoever. I asked about it in [campfire](http://campfirenow.com), the answer was the following: "that is done outside of the API, so we can have simple code". I thought all was well, and continued.  
While doing some early reading on distributed architectures, I came across [this blog post], more specifically the "[Platform layer]". About 3 days after reading that, I realized this is what VideofyMe used.  
Later, an issue in the adserver arose, Jesper started working on it. I asked if I could look over his shoulder and got introduced to [Hadoop] and [Elastic Map Reduce]. While I had a vague idea what Hadoop was, I could not think of a clear usecase. Jesper talked how the Hadoop-jobs worked and I was astonished by how much goes on behind the scenes at VideofyMe. I am grateful to Jesper for sharing his knowledge with me, I now have a clear insight on the uses for Hadoop.
