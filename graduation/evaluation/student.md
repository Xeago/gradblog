# Questionnaire

1.  **Question 1**  
    Answer 1.
2.  **Is there any interim adjustment of the assignment and why?**  
    The assignment is quite open and not limiting. Therefore it is not really an interim adjustment but rather redefining it more completely over and over again.
3.  **How does the assignment fit your education?**  
4.  **Does the assignment overlap with your interests?**  
    Yes, I am really excited in distributed systems. Designing and implementing them is really cool!*
5.  **What is the biggest issue of the assignment?**  
    For me the unknown technologies and systems. The course does not offer introduction to all technologies. It is necessary to first read about the technologies and systems, which consumes a lot of time.
6.  **How often is there a discussion about the assignment with the company supervisor?**  
    Weekly a face to face discussion, however we are in constant contact with each other through other services (e.g. e-mail).
7.  **How do you experience the discussion with the supervisor?**  
    My experience regarding discussions with the supervisor have been very positive.
8.  **How do you experience the interaction and contact with colleagues.**  
    Pleasant.
9.  **Give a description of the environment where you fulfill the graduation activities.**  
    Old customs house at a wharf furnished with desks. The lighting around my desk is not working, sufficient amount of screens on a desk, quality of the desk is low.
10. **Which activities, tasks or operations do you perform?**  
    Designing, documenting, developing, implementing and test.
11. **Which tools do you use to perform your activities or tasks?**  
    Ruby, git, puppet, elasticsearch, Tire.rb, ssh, top, trace, strace, ptrace and more; the use of these tools is **autonomic**.
12. **Which method, approach or portions of methodologies do you apply during your work?**  
    + Short iterations. Works pleasent, retains focus
    + UML => Drawing technique that does not require prior knowledge to understand
    
    And other agile methods, because they are applied by colleagues.
13. **What is the global schedule for the coming tasks?**  
    Document the end-clause of the internship, converge with production. See my [time management](time-management.html).
14. **How do you keep timesheets?**  
    Timesheets are kept with beebole. Timesheets are only kept only for school.
15. **Is there feedback to the schedule?**  
    No, but it is being watched.
16. **Which documentation do you compose?**  
    Design documents, test results and more; see my [performance plan](performance-plan.html).
17. **Why is the project useful to the company in the future?**  
    It reduces the load on the database and provides a solution for the problem that is overloading the database. It also provides better and more customizable search results.
18. **What have you missed the most during the project?**  
    Colleagues that work on the same project.
19. **What observations, comments or recommendations do you have regarding the supervision of the project from the school organisation?**  
    Please read up, get used to the language used of the involved systems, this will greatly ease the grading. (Most important: Elasticsearch.)
20. **Observations concerning the assignment**  
    None.
21. **Evaluation of the project environment.**  
    
    *Strong points*
